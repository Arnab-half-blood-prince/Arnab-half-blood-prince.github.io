I'm a Trottier Chair Fellow at the [Trottier Space Institute](https://tsi.mcgill.ca/)  and [McGill University](https://www.physics.mcgill.ca/). I am data oriented cosmologist and radio astronomer focusing on mapping the large-scale structure of the Universe with radio surveys of the 21 cm line from neutral hydrogen. My main research goals are to understand instrumental systematics and foreground challenges and developing tools to mitigate those to extract extremely weak  cosmological 21 cm signal from complex radio data. Currently I am working on measuring 21 cm signal in auto-correlation using [CHIME](https://chime-experiment.ca), a novel radio interferometer designed for wide-field high sensitivity surveys. I am also a member of [CHORD](https://www.chord-observatory.ca/), a next generation radio telescope coming up at Pentiction, British Columbia. 

In addition to these, I am also intersted in using [strong gravitational lensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05987) to detect 21 cm line emission from a individual galaxy at high redshift to measure galaxy's atomic gas content, which acts as a basic fuel of star-formation inside a galaxy. This eventually helps us to understand the evolution of galaxies and star-formation history over cosmic time.
